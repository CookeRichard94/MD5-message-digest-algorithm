# Introduction
This project was created as part of the Theory of Algorithms module in the 4th year of the Computing in Software Development taught at GMIT. The project statement was the we, the students, develop a program, written in the C programming language, that calculates the MD5 hash digest of a given input. The construction of the MD5 algorithm is outlined in the RFC 1321 document created by the Internet Engineering Task Force[1]. This request for this report was created as a late addition due the Covid_19 outbreak and aims to provide an overview of the project and to include instructions on how the program should be compiled and run, instructions on how to run the test suite included in the program, an overview of the algorithm used in the program code and a section on the complexity of the MD5 algorithm itself.

The repository contains:   

* Overview.md, which is this file.
* README.md, which is a file written in the markdown language which contains comprehensive information on how to install and run the code. It also contains a breakdown of the research involved in the original projects development.
* Video Tutorials(folder) which contains snippets of code provided via online lecture videos provided by the lecturer.
* Test(folder), this folder contains .txt files which are used as part of the testing of file input to the MD5 algorithm.
* md5.c, which is a c file used locally, exclusively for testing purposes.
* main.c, which is the file that contains the MD5 algorithm and a main method, both written in the C language, this is the file which must be compiled to run the MD5 algorithm
